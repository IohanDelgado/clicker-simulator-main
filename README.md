# About
Clickers are an interactive technology that enables instructors to pose questions to students and immediately collect and view the responses of the entire class.

They are often used to give quizzes, take polls, open discussions, and take attendance.

This is how clickers work: 1. Instructors present multiple-choice questions (verbally or with presentation software or with the i>clicker software).
